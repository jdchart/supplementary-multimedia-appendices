                        <p>Problem/hypothesis: 
                            Give a definition of the contemporary ear.
                            Situate the contemporary ear historically.
                            Explain why a focus on instrument making/instruments can be interesting for understanding the contemporary ear.

                    <li>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">An explanation around the idea of the contemporary ear, and why a study of instruments and instrument making can be useful for its comprehension.
                            The contemporary ear: our relationship with music as defined in the wake of recording. Change of perspective on the musical phenomenon. Access to other dimension, changes thought in the organisational dimension. Music creation and musical thought as the configuration of agents and relationships – networks. The contemporary ear is that of the instrument maker.
                            Go over musical thought, grammatisation and the inscription of music thought in instruments.
                            Classical ear: relationship with music as defined in the wake of notation. Musical thought deployed primarily across the organisational dimension.
                            The musicking paradigm, network paradigm.
                            Other characteristics: desacralisation of the composer figure, eroding of the boundaries between the traditional tripartite roles. Post-Adornian world.

                    <li>
                        <p>Problem/hypothesis: 
                            Definition and comprehension of this central agent.
                            Place it historically also.
                            The record is the central element of the contemporary ear.

                        <p style="font-style: italic;">A discussion around the central agent of the record. What it is today and its history. Discuss how it fits into instruments and instrument making.
                            The record is a hypothetical artefact to which musical thought tends towards. It is an idea of sound.
                            We can engage with it in two ways – measurement and manipulation. Musical thought will always be the measurement or manipulation of a record. Our engagement with it will always produce an artefact which can in turn become a central record.
                            Explain how instruments measure and manipulate records.                    
                            </p>

                            Give a historical overview of the network paradigm and where we expect to situate ourselves within it.
                            None of these models are completely satisfactory for conceiving of the musical phenomenon.

                        <p style="font-style: italic;">A critical review of ANT, meshwork and foam with the goal of situating ourselves within these ideas.
                            The main problem is with time. Even Ingold’s meshwork which concentrates on the process only manages to conceive of time retroactively. To understand the social phenomenon better we need to be able to conceive of all potentialities of existence.

                            We conceive of sound across two dimensions: energetic and temporal.
                            Music is conceived across these same two dimensions, but also across a third, organisational dimension.
                            The design of listening machines reveals how we listen as humans.

This shall be an opportunity to conceive of this research at a very conceptual level, disentwined from the concrete examples of the project. We shall begin to consider how this mindset could be applied at a more conceptual level around phenomena beyond the digital domain, using non-digital tools.
