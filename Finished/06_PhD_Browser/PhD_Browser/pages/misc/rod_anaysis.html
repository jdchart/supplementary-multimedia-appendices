        <h1>Rodrigo Constanzo - Kaizo Snare</h1>

        <hr>

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 70% 30%; align-items: center;">

            <div>
                <h2>Rodrigo Constanzo</h2>

                <p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">A more complete biography for Constanzo can be found <a href="/pages/people/rodrigo_constanzo.html" target="_blank">here</a>, however we shall start by briefly going over some points which are particularly relevant in regard to his participation on the project. 
                    Constanzo is a graduate of the University of Huddersfield, and he has known members of the <span style="font-style: italic;">FluCoMa</span> team for many years. 
                    He has been extremely active on the <span style="font-style: italic;">FluCoMa</span> forum and has continued to actively participate in testing of the tools well after his commissioned performance. 
                    He could perhaps best be described as an improviser – some of his PhD thesis<sup><a class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_01" id="footnote_link_01">1</a></sup> was dedicated to developing a framework for improvisers to analyse their own performances. 
                    He is also a talented coder – primarily in <span style="font-style: italic;">Max</span> – and instrument maker. 
                    Indeed, he operates far beyond the digital domain, having constructed and augmented instruments through various techniques, including 3d printing.
                    <br><br>
                    Constanzo started playing music around the age of four with the piano (his grandparents were both piano teachers)<sup><a class="footnote_link" href="#footnote_02" id="footnote_link_02">2</a></sup>, but soon moved on to other instruments like the guitar and the drums. 
                    It wasn’t until he reached university that he started getting into some “<span style="font-style: italic;">weirder stuff</span>” like DIY guitar pedals and <span style="font-style: italic;">circuit-bending</span>. 
                    All of this can be found within the work he has accomplished for the project. 
                    Constanzo is also regularly writes about his work – this project was no exception. 
                    There is an extensive <a href="https://rodrigoconstanzo.com/2020/08/kaizo-snare/" target="_blank">post</a> on his blog which we shall refer to further on.

                    <h2>Surface-level analysis of the performance</h2>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">The piece, called <span style="font-style: italic;">Kaizo Snare</span>, is approximately 11 minutes and 40 seconds long (listen to the piece <span id="full_piece_snippet"></span>, or watch the video to the right). 
                        It was performed at the first <span style="font-style: italic;">FluCoMa</span> gig at <span style="font-style: italic;">HCMF</span> 2019 (21<sup>st</sup> November 2019). 
                        Rodrigo played 3<sup>rd</sup> (after Owen and Olivier, before Lauren and John) on the <a href="/pages/places/bates_mill.html" target="_blank">back-right stage (stage C)</a>. 
                        We shall presently go through a segmentation of the piece which can be explored interactively in the visualisation below.
                        <br><br>
                        We shall go over this in more detail in the next section, however, let’s briefly present the setup: 
                        Constanzo is alone on stage with a kick drum, snare drum, a laptop and a table of various items for playing the snare drum with – including notably a condenser microphone. 
                        Attached to the snare drum he also has a crossfader, and a small MIDI controller that he uses to control his <span style="font-style: italic;">Max</span> patch. 
                        Around and among the audience are a set of six small, hidden robots that tap on crotales of various sizes when triggered either with a plastic or wooden stick.

            <p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">There are four main streams that we can concentrate on: 
                snare drum and crossfader activity, sample-playback activity, kick drum activity and crotale robot activity. 
                The piece can be divided into five large parts which we shall go over now.
            </p>

                            Various crossfader gestures.

                        <p>A lot heavier, more aggressive gestures. Crossfading between perhaps dry and wavefolded signal and various signals.</p>
                        <p>Much more variety on the samples, various tuned cymbal percussion sounds.</p>

                        <p>Constanzo has taken a comb (1) instead of the crossfader and is holding it against the condenser microphone. Crushing the comb to make lots of poppy sounds.</p>

                            Gesture starts with condenser mic scratching and crossfading begins relatively restrained and ends with the comb dragging in long gestures across the surface of the snare being much noisier.                    
                            </p>

                            The first two drags are followed by silence, the last one leads straight into the next section.

Phrase 4 – crushing the mic against the surface for a suspended, quieter white noise.

        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
            To summarise, in section A we have somewhat of an introduction in two long gestures that start is similar fashions. 
            Constanzo introduces us to the kind of gestural and musical vocabulary we can expect for the rest of the piece. 
            In section B, Constanzo again performs two long gestures, this time introducing a new tool – the comb. 
            He ends this section with three long drags, before launching into the central section C. 
            This central section is more energetic, with shorter phrases and a variety of different laying techniques and types of sounds – we hear the kick drum being used more here. 
            In section D, we find somewhat of a suspension – indeed, two phrases of activity followed by long moments of suspension. 
            Then, in the image of what precedes section C, we drag into the final section. 
            Section E indeed feels like the culmination of the piece. We have a short introduction that leads into a suite of 12 gestures that are built upon a pitched low bass melody (procured from a mix of kick drum and low gong samples).
        </p>

        <h4>Musical Thought</h4>

        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
            An immense quantity of gestural technique has been condensed within this performance, yet Constanzo still manages to present something that remains restrained, structured and readable. 
            Indeed, Constanzo’s experience as an improviser seems clear. 
            In the context of our line of questioning, what are the various strands of musical thought present that become apparent upon a surface-level study of this performance? 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Improvisation: the piece appears to be improvised. Constanzo talks about the improvised nature of the piece in a <a href="/pages/sources/interviews/constanzo_post_perf.html" target="_blank">post-performance interview</a>. We also remark that Constanzo does not use the entirety of the objects he made available.
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Drumming: Even if the drums are not played in a traditional way here, the setup on stage and the way Constanzo is positioned clearly refer to the popular drum-kit drumming style.
            </p></li>

                Turntablism: Indeed, this is an import strand that is quite apparent when watching the performance. Here, the snare drum’s surface replaces the vinyl, however Constanzo, in some cases quite literally, transcribes gestural techniques from turntablism to his setup here.

            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Sampling: We hear clips of sounds that do not come from the stage. Despite this, it’s worth noting that all the samples do seems to be clearly triggered by actions that we see on stage.
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Found objects: Constanzo uses a variety of “non-musical” objects against the snare drum – notably three different combs. We can consider that the performance explores the sonorous potentialities of this object under different forms. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Feedback: there are parts of the piece where feedback cuts into the sound. It is difficult to discern if this is voluntary on the part of Constanzo or not – this is something that we address in the same <a href="/pages/sources/interviews/constanzo_post_perf.html" target="_blank">post-performance interview</a>. We shall return to this in the next section, but the setup seems to imply that feedback could be desired.

            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Arc structure: there is a wealth of musical vocabulary and various typologies of phrases, however at various macroscopic levels we often discern gestures that are arced in nature – a sliding into a hive of activity that gets suspended, before sliding again.
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Focus on the performer: the lighting for the performance is very simple – the room is in complete darkness, save for an unmoving light on Constanzo. 
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Objects within the audience: the robots are activated twice during the performance, they fuse well into the recorded piece, but on the night,  it was quite surprising for the audience to suddenly find themselves surrounded by clinging sounds.
            </p></li>
            <li><p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
                Harsh noise: it’s worth noting also the harsh nature of some of the sounds on stage – notably the condenser microphone against the surface of the drum.
            </p></li>
