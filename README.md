# Supplementary Multimedia Appendices

A repository of supplementary multimedia elements of projects that were either finished, but unused in my thesis "*Performance cartography, performance cartology: musical networks for computational musicological analysis*", or unfinished but participated in the development process. This is supplementary material, not submitted in the actual thesis, but reffered to if the reader wishes to explore the development process of some of my software further.

The main multimedia appendices which are part of the submission can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.34696/p0y3-7f65).

## Structure

This repository is divided into two main folders, each containing two different types of content:

- __Finished__: These are elements that can be considered as finished projects, but that weren't directly used in my thesis.
- __Unfinished__: These are elements that are not considered as finished project. However, they did participate in the development of other software. They can be seen as experiments, drafts or sketches.

The content consists mainly of Max patches, JavaScript scripts, Python scripts and HTML/CSS/JavaScript environments. 

For full context and explinations, please consult my PhD thesis. It was submitted at the University of Huddersfield, September 2021. My research supervisors were Frédéric Dufeu and Owen Green. My PhD was carried-out as part of the Fluid Corpus Manipulation Project.
