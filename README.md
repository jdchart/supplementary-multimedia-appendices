# Supplementary Multimedia Appendices

A repository of supplementary multimedia elements of projects that were either finished, but unused in my thesis "*Performance cartography, performance cartology: musical networks for computational musicological analysis*", or unfinished but participated in the development process. This is supplementary material, not submitted in the actual thesis, but reffered to if the reader wishes to explore the development process of some of my software further.

The main multimedia appendices which are part of the submission can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.34696/p0y3-7f65![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48985961/151656030-6911134b-c855-44bc-a1e5-14d2ebfe6547.png)
